# SGP40

## Warning

I don't know what I am doing. Here especially, I removed the CRC check on the measurement as I couldn't make it work without actually looking at the code I ported.

## Credits

This is mostly copied code from Paul Clark @ SparkFun Electronics, just some minor changes to make it work on the pico.

## It just returns 0 for VOC

This is the Senserion Algorithm learning, it takes quite a while till it gives you the right numbers.

## Senserion

Those people are great! I bought like 4 chips from them and they helped me debug my schematic even when I told them that there is no money to be made from me.
